A new version of the react dine
=======
# Demo Project

The site is live at: https://reactdinerv2frontend.onrender.com

**NOTE** The backend shuts down when the page is inactive (downside of render free tier) 
please wait a few moments when visiting the page for the backend to boot back up to get the full experience! :)

New version includes authentication and authorization and a completely new backend!
Still made with Node and React.
